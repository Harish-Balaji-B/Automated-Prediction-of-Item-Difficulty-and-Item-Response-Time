# Automated-Prediction-of-Item-Difficulty-and-Item-Response-Time
Accurately predicting item difficulty and response time is crucial for developing effective and personalized educational assessments. We base this on the BEA 2024 Shared Task, leveraging its provided dataset to benchmark the performance of Word Embeddings with Neural Networks, CBOW, LSTM, LSTM with attention, GRU, BERT, ELECTRA.
